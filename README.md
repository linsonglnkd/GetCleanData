## Course Project - Getting and Cleaning Data

This repo contains two files: run_analysis.R and CodeBook.md.

The program will generate a dataset dst_tidy.  This is the tidy dataset. It is a narrow, not wide dataset. See 
[David's Assignment FAQ](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-004/forum/thread?thread_id=106)(under the section: **Is the wide or narrow form of the data tidy**).
